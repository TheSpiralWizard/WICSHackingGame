# WICS Hackathon Submission - Traveling Tetris

### IMPORTANT: Update the FILE_PATH variable in settings.py to the file path that the game is downloaded to. This can be found through opening the game in VSCode and typing 'pwd' in the terminal, then copying that path to the FILE_PATH variable. 

Traveling Tetris is meant to be a spin on the TETRIS game implemented in Pygame by [Net Ninja](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iurLoO9Mu7GqsKlxEXcf8m&si=boRpFRCnUcPWZ9ty)

We followed his tutorial to understand and recreate the TETRIS game using Pygame, then added aesthetic and quality of life changes to make the game a smoother experience and allow you to travel the world as you clear the lines of each level! Hope you have fun!
